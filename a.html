<h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>Although not strictly <em>required</em> to be encrypted, the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/encryption/">GDPR strongly recommends encryption of personally identifiable information</a>. Specifically, it is recommended to use a strong encryption standard such as AES. In the past, AES encryption was done via ECB (Electronic Code Book). This meant that identical inputs would produce identical outputs, thus allowing easy indexing and collision detection. This is no longer done, because it allows information to become known about the cleartext, even without decryption. For an example of this, see <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/14487/can-someone-explain-the-ecb-penguin/14490#14490">this stackoverflow answer about the 2013 Adobe password leak.</a></p>
<p>Current modes of operation (such as CBC) use a random IV (initialization vector) to ensure diffusion. This means that we cannot know if a given ciphertext matches our plaintext without decryption of the ciphertext. Because of this, in order to find a given email address, we must first decrypt half of the data, on average.</p>
<p>In response to this, <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/105977/encrypting-unique-fields-in-a-database/106019#106019">one stackexchange contributor</a> suggests using a high-collision hash algorithm in order to narrow down which rows could potentially match our cleartext. He helpfully provides the following algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>E = Email Address
Choose N s.t. 2^(N+3) &lt;= NUM_USERS &lt; 2^(N+4), N&gt;=0)
H(E) = (Sum each ASCII value of E)%(2^N)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>The tests</h2>
<p>I have prepared several potential implementations of this suggestion, and ran tests on them in order to discover information about performance when inserting and updating data. These implementations will either redo all hashes when a threshold is reached and <code>N</code> is changed, or store the value of <code>N</code> at the time of the last update to the row.</p>
<div id="generation" class="section level3">
<h3>Generation</h3>
<p>Data was created using <a href="https://pastebin.com/BxwuFrsL">this C# source code</a>. For convenience’s sake, it was also included at the <a href="#ListingsGeneration">end of this document</a> The original intention was to run 5 iterations each of all combinations of the following datapoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial user count
<ul>
<li>1,000</li>
<li>10,000</li>
<li>100,000</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Users to add or update per test
<ul>
<li>10</li>
<li>20</li>
<li>30</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Algorithm
<ul>
<li>Control: Using no encryption</li>
<li>Control: using a fixed number of buckets</li>
<li>Using <code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code> for updates to BucketCount, storing BucketExponent in the entity</li>
<li>Using a summary table for updates to BucketCount, storing BucketExponent in the entity</li>
<li>Using autoincremented row numbers</li>
<li>Using <code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code> for updates to BucketCount, updating all bucket numbers after threshold is passed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>However, due to time constrains I ended the tests prematurely.</p>

<h2>AddUserTests</h2>
<p>There is extreme variance in AddUserTests especially, with 2 instances taking as long as 10 seconds. The greatest interquartile range came from updating all buckets after the threshold was passed, though most extreme outliers were in storing the value of <code>N</code> while using select(*) to calculate it.</p>
